# bbsBayes' R-Universe

This is the setup for the bbsBayes [R-Universe](https://bbsBayes.r-universe.dev)

Instructions can be found in the article, 
["How to create your personal CRAN-like repository on R-universe"](https://ropensci.org/blog/2021/06/22/setup-runiverse/)


We also include rnaturalearthhires and cmdstanr in order to have those packages
available for building.
